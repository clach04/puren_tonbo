# Uses as closely as possible the exact notation of Myers's
# "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations" and
# includes direct quotes to help explain how it works

# Let A represent the initial list of values to be edited with length N
# ie. A = abcabba

# Let B represent the final list of values of the target with length M
# ie. B = cbabac

# An edit script for A and B is a set of insertion and deletion commands
# that transform A into B.  The length of a script is the number of symbols
# inserted and deleted.

# An Edit Graph for A and B has a vertex at each point in the grid (x,y)
# where: 0 <= x <= N, and 0 <= y <= M

# Horizontal edges connect each vertex to its right neighbor:
#     (x-1, y) -> (x, y)
# Vertical edges connect each vertex to the neighbor below:
#     (x, y-1) -> (x, y)
# Diagonal edges connect each vertex to the neighbor right and below:
#     (x-1,y-1) -> (x,y)
# The points (x,y) for which Ax == By are called match points

# The total number of match points between A and B is the number of
# diagonal edges in the edit graph as diagonal edges are in
# one-to-one correspondence with match points.

# A trace of length L is a sequence of L match points,
# (x1 ,y1 )(x2 ,y2 ) . . . (xL ,yL ), such that xi < xi+1 and
# yi < yi + 1 for successive points (xi,yi) and (xi + 1,yi + 1), i∈[1,L−1].

# Every trace is in exact correspondence with the diagonal edges of a path
# in the edit graph from (0,0) to (N,M).

# Each diagonal edge ending at (x,y) corresponds to a keep (match).
# Each horizontal edge to point (x,y) corresponds to a delete;
# Each vertical edge from (x,y) corresponds to an insert.

# The Algorithm - The problem of finding a shortest edit script (SES)
# then reduces to finding a path from (0,0) to (N,M) with the fewest
# number of horizontal and vertical edges.

# Let a D-path be a path starting at (0,0) that has exactly D
# non-diagonal edges.
# A 0-path must consist solely of diagonal edges.
# By simple induction, it follows that a D-path must consist of
# a (D − 1)-path followed by a non-diagonal edge and then a
# possibly empty sequence of diagonal edges called a *snake*.

# Number the diagonals in the grid of edit graph vertices so that
# diagonal k consists of the points (x,y) for which x − y = k.
# With this definition the diagonals are numbered from −M to N.

# Note that a vertical (horizontal) edge with start point on diagonal k
# has end point on diagonal k − 1 (k + 1) and a snake remains on the
# diagonal in which it starts.

# Let V: array [-Max .. Max ] of Integer
#    where V[k] contains the row index of the endpoint of a furthest
#    reaching path in diagonal k of the EditGraph

# Note: Even and odd diagonals end points are disjoint so the values
# from the even numbered diagonals can be used to calc odd numbered
# diagonals

# The pseudo code for the algorithm directly from the paper
# Constant MAX ∈ [0,M+N]
# Var V: Array [− MAX .. MAX] of Integer
# V[1]←0
# For D ← 0 to MAX Do
#     For k ← −D to D in steps of 2 Do
#            If k=−D or k≠D and V[k−1]<V[k+1] The
#                x ← V[k+1]
#            Else
#                x ← V[k−1]+1
#            y←x−k
#            While x<N and y<M and ax+1 = by+1 Do (x,y)←(x+1,y+1)
#            V[k]←x
#            If x≥N and y≥M Then
#                Length of an SES is D
#                Stop
# Length of an SES is greater than MAX
